## The new way of creating objects
kiboom provides a set of new functions that makes creating objects a breeze. All
are prefixed with `makeXXXX`, this create the object without
[adding them](https://kaboomjs.com/#make) to the scene.

But all starts with `makeObject`, this is the base game object of kiboom, instead
of set pos, anchor, scale, etc, you pass a configuration object, and it will set
the properties for you.

```js
const myGameObject = k.add(makeObject({
  pos: vec2(100, 100),
  anchor: "center",  
}));
```

There's a lot of other functions, like `makeSprite`, `makeText`, `makeRect`,
etc. We will see them in the next sections.
