description: The new way for creating objects in Kaboom.js
---

kiboom provides a set of new functions that makes creating objects a breeze. All
are prefixed with `makeXXXX`, this create the object without
[adding them](https://kaboomjs.com/#make) to the scene.

But all starts with `makeObject`, this is the base game object of kiboom, instead
of set pos, anchor, scale and other components, you pass a configuration object,
and it will set the components for you.

```js
// Creates the object without adding it to the scene
const myGameObject = makeObject({
  pos: vec2(100, 100),
  anchor: "center",  
});

// Add the object to the scene
k.add(myGameObject);
```
