import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'


This plugin is only compatible with the version 3000 of Kaboom.js,
so make sure you have it installed.

## Installation
<PackageManagers pkg="kiboom" />

## Usage

We recommend have a separate file for the engine, and another for the game.

```js
// engine.js
import kaboom from "kaboom";
import { kiboom } from "kiboom";

export const k = kaboom({
    // This loads your plugin
    plugins: [ kiboom ],
});

```

```js
// game.js
// This should be your entry file
import k from "./engine.js";

k.add(k.makeSprite({
    pos: k.vec2(100, 100),
    sprite: "player",
}));
```
