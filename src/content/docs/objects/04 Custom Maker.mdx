description: Create your own maker functions in kiboom
---

kiboom has the possibility to create your own maker functions, 
this is a powerful feature that can save you a lot of time.

For create a maker, we recommend extend the base maker, `makeObject`, so we use
the `extendMaker()` function.

> extendMaker(baseMaker, defaultOpt, componentsApply) | 
[In API](https://ref.kiboom.lajbel.com/functions/extendMaker.html)

- `baseMaker`: The base maker to extend.
- `defaultOpt`: The default options for the new maker.
- `componentsApply`: The components to apply in the new maker.

```js
const makeBulletOptions = makeOptions(() => ({
    speed: 100,
    damage: 10,
}));
```
