description: Create your own maker functions in kiboom

kiboom has the possibility to create your own maker functions, 
this is a powerful feature that can save you a lot of time.

For create a maker, we recommend extend the base maker, `makeObject`, so we use
the `extendMaker()` function.

> extendMaker(baseMaker, defaultOpt, componentsApply) | 
[In API](https://https://kiboom-ref.pages.dev/functions/extendMaker.html)

- `baseMaker`: The base maker to extend.
- `defaultOpt`: The default options for the new maker. You must use 
`makeOptions`
- `componentsApply`: The components to apply in the new maker.

```js
// We create some options with defaults
const makeEnemyOpt = makeOptions(() => ({
    speed: 100,
    hp: 100,
}));

// We create the new maker
const makeEnemy = extendMaker(makeObject, makeEnemyOpt, (opt) => [
    // here our components list
    hp(opt.hp),
    move(LEFT, opt.speed),
]);

// Now we can use our new maker
k.add(makeEnemy({
    hp: 200,             // We can override our maker options
    speed: 200,          // We can override our maker options
    pos: vec2(100, 100), // We can modify the base options of makeObject
    anchor: "topleft",   // We can modify the base options of makeObject
}));
```

In the example above, we create a new maker called `makeEnemy`, this maker
extends the `makeObject` maker, and adds the `hp` and `move` components, and 
also a `speed` and `hp` options.

The idea is to create a maker that is easy to use and that can be reused in
different parts of the game. Also you should extend the most useful maker for
you, it can be `makeObject`, `makeSprite`, `makeText`, etc.
