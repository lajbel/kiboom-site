description: All about the base maker of kiboom, `makeObject`

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Makers can be extendable, and the base maker is `makeObject`. This is the base
of all other makers in kiboom, and probbably **should be the base maker** of
your own makers.

`makeObject()` returns a new game object, with these default components: 
[PosComp](https://kaboomjs.com/#PosComp),
[ScaleComp](https://kaboomjs.com/#ScaleComp),
[AnchorComp](https://kaboomjs.com/#AnchorComp),
[RotationComp](https://kaboomjs.com/#RotationComp) and
[ZComp](https://kaboomjs.com/#ZComp),

These are the typical transform components of a game object in other engines,
like Unity. You can also pass tags. See all options in the 
<a href="https://lajbel.github.io/kiboom/types/ObjOpt.html" target="_blank">API</a>

```js
const myObject = makeObject({
    pos: vec2(100, 100),
    scale: vec2(2, 2),
    anchor: "center",
    rotate: 90,
    z: 1,
    tags: [ "entity" ],
});
```

<Aside type="tip">
By default, all kiboom objects are anchored at center! This will save you
a lot of `anchor()` components.
</Aside>

If you will set in all your game objects the same components, **why don't use a
base for all?** This is the idea of `makeObject`, and all other makers in kiboom.
