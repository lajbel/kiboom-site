title: Extending Makers
description: All about the other makers of kiboom, `makeObject`
---

The idea of kiboom is create your own maker functions, but we provide a set of
general use makers that you can use in your game. 

All of them extends `makeObject`, there's an introduction to the most important 
ones, but you can find all in the [API](https://https://kiboom-ref.pages.dev/).

## makeObject()

`makeObject()`, creates a game object with some base transform 
components. Is useful for use as a parent object or for create new makers.

```js
const myParent = k.add(makeObject({
    pos: vec2(100, 100),}
));

const child = myParent.add(makeObject({
    pos: vec2(50, 50), // real position: 150, 150
}));
```

## makeRender()

Make render is another used as base maker, it extends `makeObject` and adds color
and opacity components. I don't recommend use it directly, but you can use it
in other makers as `makeSprite` or `makeText`.

```js
// Make a sprite

const mySprite = k.add(makeSprite({
    pos: vec2(100, 100),   // from makeObject
    sprite: "player",      // from makeSprite
    color: "#ffffff",      // from makeRender
    opacity: 0.5,          // from makeRender
}));

// Make a text

const myText = k.add(makeText({
    pos: vec2(100, 100),   // from makeObject
    text: "Hello world!",  // from makeText
    color: "#fffffff",     // from makeRender
    opacity: 0.5,          // from makeRender
}));
```

## makeArea()

Useful for create areas, like collision areas, or areas for interact with the player.

```js
const myArea = k.add(makeArea({
    pos: vec2(100, 100),  // from makeObject
    width: 50,            // from makeArea
    height: 50,           // from makeArea
}));
```
