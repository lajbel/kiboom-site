To understand the base of kiboom, you need to understand the `make()` function.
It receives a components array like `add()`, but doesn't add the object to the
scene.

```js
const bean = k.make([
  k.pos(100, 100),
  k.sprite("bean"),
]);

k.add(bean);
```

## Object Maker

An Object Maker is a function that receives a configuration and returns
a new fgame object using `make()`. It have benefits, like be extendable and
modifiable. Kiboom provides a set of object makers, like `makeSprite`,
`makeText`, all of thems are extended from the base maker, `makeObject`.

```js
const myObject = k.makeSprite({
  pos: k.vec2(100, 100),  // from makeObject()
  sprite: "player",       // from makeSprite()
});
```

<Aside type="note" >
This is the same "prefab" concept in other engines like Unity.

The maker functions will speed up your development, and make your code more
cleaner, also improves modulization.
