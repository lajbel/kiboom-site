title: Extended Makers
description: All about the other makers of kiboom, `makeObject`
---

The idea of kiboom is create your own maker functions, but we provide a set of
general use makers that you can use in your game. All of them extends
`makeObject`, there's an introduction to the most important ones.

## makeObject()

`makeObject()`, as we saw, creates a game object with some base transform 
components. Is useful for use as a parent object, and also extend it.

```js
const myParent = k.add(makeObject({
    pos: vec2(100, 100),}
));

const child = myParent.add(makeObject({
    pos: vec2(50, 50), // real position: 150, 150
}));
```

## makeRender()

Make render is another used as base maker, it extends `makeObject` and adds color
and opacity components. I don't recommend use it directly, but you can use it
in other makers as `makeSprite` or `makeText`.
